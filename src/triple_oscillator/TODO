TODO LIST
=========

X Basic Oscillator Voice
X Voice stealing
X Volume Envelope
  Copy LMMS filters
X   Standard filter types
    2x LowPass
    Formant Filter
X CUT Envelope
X RES Envelope
X LFOs
X Presets
X Velocity
    Double check order of amplifiers. (pre or post filter?)
  Pitch bend
X   Aquire pitch bend
X   Smooth input (one-pole filter)
X   Rework Oscillator
    Sounds wrong with detune. (base+detune)*bend => (base*bend)+detune
    Fix value 127 = 1 octave
X   2-byte MIDI values
  Improve voice with proper oscillator code. (Antialiasing)
    Sine
X   Triangle
X   Saw
X   Square
X   Moog
X   Exp
    Noise
  Double-check for working SYNC mod in both AA and non-AA code
  Revisit float vs float[] ports
  "Un-map" controls like "LFO speed". [20ms, 20000ms] instead of [0.001,1.0]
    sustain level is "backwards", should be equal to the level, not 1-n.
  Port-groups, parameters
  Figure out pulse-modulation versus frequency-modulation fiasco (Stefan F)
  Tempo-sync knobs?
  Split out instrument code
  Create standalone triposc voice plugin
  Add lagged inputs wherever else it is needed
  Optimize (Profile!)
  Address all TODOs and FIXMEs

BUGS:
  Add default short voice envelope (currently "popping" with min envelope)
  Preset "The Master" is broken
