TODO LIST
=========

X Basic Oscillator Voice
X Voice stealing
X Volume Envelope
X Copy LMMS filters
X   Standard filter types
X   2x LowPass
X   Formant Filter
X CUT Envelope
X RES Envelope
X LFOs
X Presets
X Velocity
X   Double check order of amplifiers. (pre or post filter?)
  Pitch bend
X   Aquire pitch bend
X   Smooth input (one-pole filter)
X   Rework Oscillator
    Sounds wrong with detune. (base+detune)*bend => (base*bend)+detune
    Fix value 127 = 1 octave
X   2-byte MIDI values
  Improve voice with proper oscillator code. (Antialiasing)
X   Sine
X   Triangle
X   Saw
X   Square
X   Moog
X   Exp
    Noise
  "Un-map" controls like "LFO speed". [20ms, 20000ms] instead of [0.001,1.0]
    sustain level is "backwards", should be equal to the level, not 1-n.
  Port-groups, parameters
  Double-check for working SYNC mod in both AA and non-AA code
  Revisit float vs float[] ports
  Figure out pulse-modulation versus frequency-modulation fiasco (Stefan F)
  Split out instrument code
  Create standalone triposc voice plugin
  Add lagged inputs wherever else it is needed
  Filters may get in an odd state when switching - need to reset on switch
  Optimize (Profile!)
  Address all TODOs and FIXMEs
  Tempo-sync knobs?

BUGS:
  Add default short voice envelope (currently "popping" with min envelope)
  Preset "The Master" is broken
