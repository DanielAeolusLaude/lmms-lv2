                             LMMS Plugins for LV2
                            ======================

This is the beginning of a port of LMMS plugins to LV2.

Initially there will be some effort required for scaffolding, mainly handling
multiple voices etc..  Once this is done, other plugins will come along a
little bit quicker.

There are a number of plugins that will require some extension to LV2 in order
for them to work in a ``Nice'' way.

Key [W]=Working on, [C]=Complete, [X]=Not planned

Instruments:

[ ] AudioFileProcessor - playing audio files.
        Would be nice to coordinate efforts with LV2 team, regarding host-side sample loading.
    
[ ] BitInvader - 'simple and dirty' wavetable synthesis.
        Should be easy enough, might require "Atom" extension for the scribble data
    
[ ] Kicker - drum synthesis.
        Easy
    
[W] LB302 - a monophonic implementation of the TB303 sound.
        Simplified due to monophonic nature and because I'm familiar with code-base
    
[ ] Mallets - a struck-instrument synthesizer
        Is this necessary due to CMT on LV2?
    
[ ] Organic - an additive organ synthesizer.
        I'm not a huge fan of this one, so low priority
    
[ ] FreeBoy - an emulator of the sound chip of the Nintendo Game Boy.
        Will require BitInvader's "Graph" widget and data-passing.
    
[ ] PatMan - a GUS-compatible patch instrument.
        Never used it...
    
[X] SF2 Player - the official SoundFont2 player.
        Not neccessary with FluidSynth LV2 plugin
    
[ ] SID - an emulator of the sound chips used by the C64.
        A fun one, but not huge priority of mine
    
[X] Singerbot - a 'singing' sound synthesizer.
        Unmaintained, might try it once LMMS restores this one
    
[W] TripleOscillator - the 'standard' subtractive synthesis module.
        Priority #2 behind LB303.  Will require writing the initial oscillator code
        and voice-managing code.  And the original oscillator code is less than ideal
        for a C port.
    
[X] VeSTige - VSTi-hosting plugin
        Not required with current work on FST
    
[ ] Vibed - powerful vibrating-string synthesis module.
        Requires BitInvader's graph
    
[X] ZynAddSubFX - A powerful hybrid synthesizer 
        There is already zyn for LV2, right?

Effects:

[ ] Bass Booster - Maximizes bass sound

[X] Peak Controller - Control other parameters with the input peak levels
        This is tied too closely to LMMS's mixer to be useful here.
        A rewrite is necessary (and more trivial to be honest)

[ ] Spectrum Analyzer - Visualize audio response
        There are other Visualizers in the JACK/LV2 world. Lowest priority.

[ ] Stereo Enhancer - Simulate a wider stereo separation

[ ] Stereophonic Matrix - Mix stereo input and output in a completely flexible way
        Might not be too useful outside of LMMS.  Originally designed to
        work-around some limitation in the mixer.
